# analytical-droplet-shape
Analytical calculation of the shape of an axisymmetric droplet on a smooth solid surface for a given liquid volume and Youngâ€™s contact angle as presented by [Chamakos, 2017](http://dspace.lib.ntua.gr/xmlui/handle/123456789/44746).

## Run example
Launch "analytical_droplet_shape.m" from Octave console. Define the volume of the droplet (typically smaller than 5 ul) and the Young's contact angle (between ~0 and ~180 degrees).
